    <h1>Letters From Jail #1</h1>
    <h2>September 6, 1986</h2>
    <p>
“This man has a sixties mentality,” the female prosecutor said. And, unstated, “He ought to be punished for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
“You may think the drugs you sold were not harmful,” Judge Jennings said, “but they inevitably lead to worse ones.” What era mentality is that?
    </p>
    <p>
The judge pronounced the sentence: “Ten years of incarceration” - I stood very still - “with nine suspended.”
    </p>
    <p>
One year. Or less. How much less I do not yet know. Estimates I’ve heard range from 45 days to six months.
    </p>
    <p>
I was taken directly from the courtroom to a cell outside and was told by a deputy that I would serve my sentence there (here) at the Adult Detention Center, a jail in Fairfax City. 
    </p>
    <p>
Then he left me in a concrete cell for an hour while my paperwork was processed.
    </p>
    <p>
From there I was taken downstairs via private passages to G(eneral) H(olding) 2 — the same cell I’d shared with around 20 drunks the night of my arrest in March. I sat on a concrete bench for about three hours with 18 others — some of whom would be processed with me in the days to come.
    </p>
    <p>
Later that afternoon I was taken to a receiving cell — R44 — where I spent Friday night, Saturday, and part of Sunday. It was hellish.
    </p>
    <p>
Imagine a concrete cell ten feet high, seven feet wide, and eight feet deep. A bench-shelf ran across the 	back wall, and — thank ghod — had a thin mattress on it. In the corner to the right of the door was a stainless steel commode/toilet. A fluorescent light overhead was lit 24 hours. The door had a barred window and a slot which opened to admit trays of “food.” (Pig swill is a better description.) With rare exceptions, when I was taken out for “classification,” etc., I spent my time in that windowless cell doing nothing, allowed nothing to read. I dozed much of that time, escaping reality in vague dreams, punctuated by noises from the corridor outside and cells down the way. It was air-conditioned, and uncomfortably cold. There was no blanket, no pillow. Eventually my body ached in every position.
    </p>
    <p>
Around 3 AM, Sunday morning, I was taken to a room where I surrendered all my clothes — my watch and everything in my pockets had already been taken – showered, and was issued my prison clothes, rather old and threadbare.
    </p>
    <p>
From there I was taken to DT-2, a cell-block where I was given a cellroom off the dayroom. It was larger and nicer than R44 — in addition to a separate commode and toilet, it had a table and lights that dimmed at night, and I was issued two sheets (very thin) and a blanket (ratty and too short).
    </p>
    <p>
This began a less unpleasant existence. I didn’t sleep much the rest of that night — I was slept out — but the surroundings were better.
    </p>
    <p>
Around 5 AM the lights came on, my cell door unlocked with a loud bang, and I rose to join eight others in the dayroom for breakfast. I gave my stainless-steel tray of swill to the others and returned to my bed. At 9 AM I had to leave my cell for the dayroom — my cell door was locked and my cell inaccessible until evening.
    </p>
    <p>
The others in the dayroom were four whites and four blacks. I recognized several from GH-2 — two had gone in with me that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
I found it easy to make friends with all of them, and soon began playing cards with them. (I played Spades with “spades.”) Jesse was a tall black with a motor-mouth — a line of jive and clever with cards. He christened me Theo. (I am officially Theodore White here.) Rick Washington was a soft-spoken black with whom I became friends. The whites stayed more by themselves that day. I found my accent thickening as I spent most of my time with the blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
The day (Sunday) passed quickly and enjoyably. We played cards, the food got better, and I found myself smiling to myself in bed that night. This isn’t that bad, I thought to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
Half of us were transferred to permanent cells in the general population that evening — the rest of us to follow 24 hours later. During the “night,” three new ones were added.
    </p>
    <p>
Monday morning I rose for breakfast feeling pretty good. The day passed with card games — something I always enjoy — and conversation. I used the phone (collect outgoing calls only) to talk to my mother and my daughter. A minister came by and gave us pencils and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
Around 9 PM five of us were transferred “upstairs.” I was separated from my newfound friends and put in Cellblock A-5.
    </p>
    <p>
This is a smaller cellblock than DT-2. The dayroom is smaller, and there are only four separate cells off of it. (DT-2 had six.) There are seven of us here, and as the newest I sleep on the floor of the dayroom with two others. No privacy at all. This does not strike me as an improvement. But we have a TV set (13" B&W), cards, etc. Four blacks and three whites, all “older men” like me.
    </p>
    <p>
When I came in, everyone was watching Monday Night Football, so I haven’t really “met” most of them yet. (Instead, I’ve written this.) I’ve yet to settle into the routine here, but I hope I’ll move up to a cell eventually. I’ll keep you posted.
    </p>
