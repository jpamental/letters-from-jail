              <h1>Prologue</h1>
            </header>
			<p>In early 1985, disgusted by the crappy quality of the marijuana then locally available, I decided to buy a higher quality in bulk (by the pound) and begin selling it (at a fair price) to my friends. This I did, quite successfully. Indeed, my business was so good that I expanded my range of products to include not only “boutique” buds but “shrooms” and acid – all drugs I personally approved of. But, it turned out, business was too good. The “traffic” to and from my house attracted attention. Two of my neighbors complained to the police, who began surveillance of me (from a white van parked up a side street) in May 1985.</p>
			<p>Nearly a year later, on March 20, 1986, I answered the door early in the evening, to be confronted by two men in business suits, who pointed guns at me and told me they were cops and I was under arrest.</p>
			<p>I was backed into my dining room and handcuffed while uniformed police poured into my house to begin searching it. After only a few minutes I was taken, coatless, outside to a police car. The temperature was around freezing. </p>
			<p>I was held in the car for perhaps twenty minutes, then taken to the Falls Church police station in the basement of City Hall. There I was placed in one of two holding cells to while away the next six or eight hours, interrupted, but not often enough, for fingerprinting and an interview. The cell, typically, was a concrete-and-tile room big enough to contain a concrete shelf three feet wide and seven feet long, and a combination toilet and sink. I spent most of my time sitting or lying on the bare concrete shelf. </p>
			<p>Around 3 AM, after a magistrate was brought in to sign six charges (all counts of drug possession) against me and set my bond at $50,000, I was taken to the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, and put in a holding cell which was effectively a drunk tank. It was only a Thursday, but the large cell held over twenty men.</p>
			<p>The room was long and had narrow concrete bench seats running down each long wall, with a waist-high tiled-concrete partition across the far end, beyond which were a sink and a toilet. The front wall was just floor to ceiling bars. Men sat or sprawled on all the available bench space; more were lying on the floor amid cigarette butts and general filth. There was little conversation; most were dozing. I found a spot on the floor and tried to sleep.</p>
			<p>At 5:30 in the morning they brought us “breakfast,” which was passed in through a slot in the barred door. Breakfast consisted of a tin cup of “coffee” (actually, I learned later, chicory – caffeine free), a half-pint carton of milk, an individual-size box of cereal (I got cornflakes) and a tin bowl at least one-quarter full of white sugar. I was able to eat relatively little before my gag reflex overcame my appetite.</p>
			<p>The barred end of the cell faced the receiving desk, and people came and went noisily. It was hard to sleep in that cell, but there wasn’t much else to do. I was asked what I was in for, and when I said “possession with intent to distribute,” I was immediately asked what I’d had. “Oh, man, I wish I’d of known you when I was Out,” one man told me. And I was told some hash had been smuggled in and smoked earlier that night, before my arrival. </p>
			<p>I spent only until the middle of the afternoon in that cell before I was released on bail (the deed to my house guaranteed my bond). I had been confined for less than twenty-four hours. (And that was counted as my first day of incarceration when my total time was calculated.) But in many ways that first brief period of confinement was worse than the three months I subsequently spent – the more so because I had not expected it, was not emotionally ready for it, and was both frightened and discomforted by it. </p>
			<p>It does something to you when you’re chained together with twenty other men and taken into a courtroom in which your gallery is divided from the rest of the room by bulletproof glass. It tells you that the life you’ve lived and the attitude you had about yourself no longer apply; now you are in the charge of the state.</p>
			<p>When I got home I had to wash my hair to rid myself of the cigarette-butt stink of that cell.</p>
			<p>The period between my arrest and sentencing was one of considerable depression: It was hard to watch the news on TV when someone was shown being arrested, under arrest, or incarcerated – no matter what the crime was, I empathized with the experience the arrested person was undergoing. In those months I had a number of court appearances which culminated in my appearance for sentencing (I pleaded guilty) on September 5, 1986. I went directly from the courtroom to jail, without leaving the building. I did not pass Go.</p>
			<p>Subsequently, while incarcerated, I wrote twenty-one letters from jail for publication for my friends. The first fourteen were published – by the Nielsen Haydens, Victor Gonzalez, Mark Kernes, Lucy Huntzinger, and John D. Berry – before my release on December 4th. The Nielsen Haydens and Tom Weber typed up the remaining seven (all were hand-written), but once I was out, the urgency to publish them diminished. Eventually Lenny Bailes volunteered to publish some of them, and I sent him #15, #16, and the first half of #17. I published the rest myself in August 1987, editing out material which no longer struck me as of much interest.</p>
			<p>Their publication here is their first appearance as a single “volume,” collected together for the first time. In addition to the letters themselves, there is a Postscript, written in 1993, describing my exit from jail, and an Epilogue, written in 2011, which wraps up the last (I hope) threads of this story. There is some irony in that Epilogue.</p>
